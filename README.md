# Function-to-check-BST-or-BT-is-balanced-or-not

# Problem:
Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. A balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one. The tree will be passed as an argument to the function and the function will return true if the tree is balanced, otherwise it will return false.

# Explanation of Implementation:
In this problem, I have applied the divide & conquer technique. I calculated the height of left and right subtrees and checked if height difference of left and right subtree is less than or equal to one and that is the case for left and right subtrees or not, if not then return false.
